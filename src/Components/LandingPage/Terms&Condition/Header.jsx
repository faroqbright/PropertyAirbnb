If we match an online retailerâ€™s price, it must include shipping charges in the price of the item. The item must be identical and must have the same manufacturer part number.

        Some parts on your order may have updated replacement information. Our
        parts specialists will verify and ship out the updated replacement at
        our discretion.
        <br />
        In the meantime, the updated replacement part number will usually be
        provided on the packing list and invoice. Vehicle diagrams displayed on
        this website are for general illustration purposes only.
        <br />
        Vehicles depicted are shown as a sample vehicle of the same model only.
        Details of a selected vehicle may vary from the vehicle shown, depending
        on the selected features.
        <br />
        The diagrams are used as a point of reference and should not be used as
        the primary resource when ordering a part. The catalog is provided as a
        convenience to our customers.
        <br />
        <br />
        We do not guarantee the accuracy of the information provided within this
        catalog. While we try to maintain a near-perfect catalog, a small number
        of parts may be listed incorrectly.
        <br />
        Our website is a general catalog and does not reflect our actual
        inventory, please contact us for inventory information. We reserve the
        right to refuse to process an order for any reason.
        <br />
        Your order confirmation is an offer to buy, not a completed sales
        contract. Order acceptance and the completion of the contract between
        both the purchasing and seller parties will take place on the shipment
        of the products ordered.
        <br />
        <br />
        Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does
        not mean our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute a
        confirmation of our offer to sell. We reserve the right at any time
        after the receipt of your order to cancel your order for any reason.
        <br />
        <br />
        If the order is cancelled, the authorization on your card will be voided
        and no money will be charged. If your card was charged, a full refund
        will be issued to your credit card.
